eupleridae.R, this is Feliformia but not Feloidea



TODO

Afrotheria, looks like elephants (3) and sea cows (3) are a possibility
Reference genomes for either don't look so great, the scaffolds aren't assembled into chromosomes, but could be fine? They are UCSC assemblies


Turtles, so far looks good for Emydidae
If they aren't too diverged / not too many SNPs, there are some other nearby turtles that could also potentially be used
